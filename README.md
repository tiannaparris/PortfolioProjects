## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Movie Gross Earnings Analysis
**Code:** [`Python Correlation Project.ipynb`](https://github.com/tiannaparris/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Python%20Correlation%20Project.ipynb)

**Description:** There dataset contains a list of movies released between 1980 and 2022.  The records include the title of the moves, it's rating, genre, release date, budget, gross, etc.. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing correlation between budget and gross earnings and hypothesis testing.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

**Results:** Python functions to calculate and plot nuget vs gross earning, hypothesis testing, detecting statistically significant result used to determine that Votes and budget have the highest correlation to gross earnings while the company has none.
